TODO (In some kind of importance order, X=Done)
-----------------------------------------------

X Fix configuration dialog => update properties

X Fix properties for yasim and jsbsim surface forces
X Make axis mapping to work

- Add save default or aircraft and per device options

- Clean up the code, make it C++

X Add different gains for surface force axis?
  : Can be done in nasal / aircraft setup

X Add AoA setting to stick shaker => trigger
- Check that stick shaker works with rumblepads!

X Add stick pusher effect and its AoA setting
- Any other way to detect stall? What real devices use?

- Add speed dependent autocenter force to be used instead
  of constant forces if they do not work properly

- Add engine rpm shaker?

X Add ground bumps?
  : Simple test done

- Make autocenter and gain to not require device reconfigure

- Force feedback trimming, check directions!



BUGS
----

X With only control surface forces enabled, pushing or pulling stick 
  to the limit causes forces to turn stick also sideways, even though
  the force should be 0

- After reiniting menu, menubar hides. Press F10 to show it.

- Quick stick movements may cause huge oscillations. Maybe add
  a low pass filter to the forces?
